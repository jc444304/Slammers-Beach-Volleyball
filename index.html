            <h1>Slammers Beach Volleyball</h1>

            <p>We are a small local company, hoping to improve our business by getting on the net. We get about 100 people playing at Slammers each week. The web site should produce an increase of customers of at least 50%. Volleyball is a great family sport, so we think more young families would enjoy being part of what we offer – volleyball (including professional competitions sometimes), socialising, licensed bar (happy hour every day from 6-7pm), available to hire for functions – fun and fitness.
                We get players of all ages, but mostly they are 35 – 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience, getting kids playing while they’re in high school (15 – 30). We think more people would play and come and watch competitions if they knew about us more.
